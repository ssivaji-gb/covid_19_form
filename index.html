        <p>
            Covid-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
            It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets and can lead to symptoms ranging from mild cold-like
            illness to severe pneumonia or even death, especially in people with underlying health conditions.
